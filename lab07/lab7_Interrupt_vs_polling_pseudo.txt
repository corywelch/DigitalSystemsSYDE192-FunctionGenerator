    Poll state of pin 4, if it is hight print: "Polling Checked pin 4 found to be HIGH Start/Continue Program"
    Delay for 0.5sec
    Setup for loop to count from 1 to 15
      If your interrupt variable (state) is high print 1 to 15 with a 0.5sec delay between prints statements
      If your interrupt variable (state) is LOW print: "Interrupt Detected stop counting" stop counting and wait for a change in the interrupt variable
    After you have counted to 15 print: "Check polling" and poll pin 4, if it is hight repeat counting/interrupting.
    If the polled pin is LOW print: "Polling LOW detected stop program" then wait until polling pin changes
